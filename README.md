# Library-Database-System

This is an school project, made using Turbo C++.
It illustrates the use of fstream.h to write and read binary files, to manage a very barebones library database.

This program can manage records of the users registered in the library, and the books that are registered in the library, and enables a user to rent one single book at a time.

<ol>

<li>Note: The binary files used in this program are not generated at runtime, and must be generated by other means (such as calling ofstream fout open(), from another program).</li>

<li>Note: Don't try to input whatever you want, when you are creating or modifying records, and refer to the classes declared. Not following the class specificationsusually breaks the ofstream and ifstream write() and read() functions.</li>

</ol>
